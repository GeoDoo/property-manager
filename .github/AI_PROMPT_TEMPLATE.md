# AI Prompt Template

When asking AI for help with this project, use this template to ensure consistency:

```
Working on Property Manager (see TECH_STACK.md for standards). Please read and follow our AI_GUIDELINES.md.

[Your specific question/task here]

Remember: 
- Backend: Java 17, Spring Boot, Gradle only
- Frontend: React+TS, TailwindCSS, React Query (no Redux)
- Security: ALWAYS USE .env FOR SECRETS AND SENSITIVE DATA
- Never introduce technologies not in TECH_STACK.md
```

## How To Use

1. Copy this template at the beginning of your conversation with AI
2. This sets clear boundaries for what technologies are acceptable
3. If AI suggests something outside these boundaries, remind it to check TECH_STACK.md

## Example Usage

```
Working on Property Manager (see TECH_STACK.md for standards). Please read and follow our AI_GUIDELINES.md.
